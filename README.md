Replace the lib folder and the pubspec.yaml file with the attached files.

Possibly add assets like images or fonts and adjust the AndroidManifest.xml and build.gradle files file to add data permissions.

Run the command "flutter packages get" in the studio terminal.

flutter run (with a running emulator or real device connected to your machine) to view the app.
